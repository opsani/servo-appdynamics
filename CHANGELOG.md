# CHANGELOG

Servo is an Open Source framework supporting Continuous Optimization of
infrastructure and applications via the Opsani optimization engine. Opsani
provides a software as a service platform that optimizes the resourcing and
configuration of cloud native applications to reduce operational costs and
increase performance. Servo instances are responsible for connecting the
optimizer service with the application under optimization by linking with the
metrics system (e.g. Prometheus, Thanos, DataDog, etc) and the orchestration
system (e.g. Kubernetes, CloudFormation, etc) in order to apply changes and
evaluate their impact on cost and performance.

Servo is distributed under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license.
